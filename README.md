# HEVY-BOT

This is a modular Python automation bot for [Hevy](https://www.hevyapp.com/), designed to boost community engagement by automatically liking workouts, following active users, and unfollowing inactive or unreciprocated follows.

> This is a **showcase version**. Sensitive tokens, credentials, and internal datasets have been removed.

## Features

- **Workout Liking**: Likes recent workouts from discovered users to boost interaction.
- **Token Health Monitoring**: Confirms valid session with the Hevy API.
- **Discord Webhooks**: Sends status summaries and errors directly to Discord.

## How it Works

The bot is orchestrated through `hevy_bot.py` and works in five key stages, using a combination of **GET** and **POST** requests to interact with the Hevy API:

### 1. **Get Current Network**
- `GET /following/{username}` â€” gets who you follow
- `GET /followers_paged/{username}` â€” gets your followers  
Used to identify new users and monitor engagement status.

### 2. **Discover Users to Follow**
- `GET /discover_feed_workouts_paged` â€” scrapes the discover feed
- `GET /workout_likes/{workout_id}` â€” pulls likers of a workout  
Users are chosen based on commenting and liking behavior. Already-followed and whitelisted users are skipped.

### 3. **Follow Users**
- `POST /follow` with `{ "username": "target_user" }`  
New users are followed and logged with a timestamp. Stops automatically if rate-limited or blocked.

### 4. **Unfollow Users**
- `POST /unfollow` with `{ "username": "target_user" }`  
Users are unfollowed if:
  - They havenâ€™t followed back after `N` days
  - Theyâ€™ve been inactive for `X` days
  - Theyâ€™re not on the whitelist

### 5. **Like Workouts**
- `GET /user_workouts_paged?username=target&limit=1` â€” fetches latest workout
- `POST /workout/like/{workout_id}` â€” likes the workout  
Each like is logged and checked to avoid repetition.

### 6. **Send Discord Summary**
- `POST` to a configured Discord webhook  
Sends a log of who was followed/unfollowed with optional user mentions for alerts.

All actions are rate-limited with randomized delays to mimic human behavior.
